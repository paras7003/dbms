        <p>In MySQL, a clause is a part of a SQL statement that provides additional information about the operation being performed. A clause typically follows the main keywords in a SQL statement and specifies conditions, filters, and other criteria that affect the outcome of the query.</p>
        <br>1.WHERE clause
        <br><br>The WHERE clause is a commonly used clause in MySQL that is used to filter rows from a table based on specified conditions. It follows the FROM clause in a SELECT statement and can include one or more conditions that must be satisfied for a row to be included in the result set.
        <br>SYNTAX = select column_list from table_name where condition;

        <br>SYNTAX = SELECT column1, column2, column3
