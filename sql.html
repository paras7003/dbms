            SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, retrieve, update and delete data from databases. SQL is a standard language that can be used with a variety of database management systems, including MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and others.
