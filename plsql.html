            PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is a procedural extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used for Oracle database management systems. It is a programming language that enables the creation of stored procedures, functions, triggers, packages, and other database objects that are used to automate database administration and application development tasks.

PL/SQL code is executed on the server-side, which means that it runs within the database server and not on the client side. This makes it a powerful tool for managing data in large databases.

<br>PL/SQL allows developers to combine SQL statements with procedural constructs such as loops, conditionals, and exception handling. This enables developers to write complex database applications that can perform data manipulation, retrieval, and maintenance tasks efficiently.

Some of the key features of PL/SQL include:

<br><br>Strong data typing: PL/SQL supports strong data typing, which means that each variable and parameter has a specific data type that must be declared at the time of creation.

<br>Procedural constructs: PL/SQL supports procedural constructs such as loops, conditionals, and exception handling, which enable developers to create more complex applications.

<br>Modularity: PL/SQL supports modularity through the use of packages, which enable developers to group related procedures and functions together for easier maintenance.

<br>Error handling: PL/SQL provides robust error handling capabilities, which enable developers to handle exceptions that occur during the execution of their code.

<br><br>Overall, PL/SQL is a powerful tool for database management and application development that enables developers to write complex, efficient, and maintainable code for Oracle database systems.
